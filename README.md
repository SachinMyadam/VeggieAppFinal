VeggieApp: A Real-Time Vegetable E-Commerce Platform
VeggieApp is a comprehensive, cross-platform mobile e-commerce application designed for selling fresh vegetables. It features a seamless, real-time user experience powered by a robust backend and a fully functional web-based admin panel for complete operational control.

ü•ï Project Overview
VeggieApp addresses the need for a modern, convenient way for customers to purchase fresh produce. The ecosystem consists of two primary components:

The Customer Mobile App (React Native & Expo): An intuitive application for iOS and Android where users can browse products, manage a shopping cart, place orders, and receive live updates and push notifications.

The Admin Web Panel (HTML, CSS, JS): A secure, browser-based dashboard for business owners to manage inventory, pricing, and order fulfillment in real-time.

The entire system is built on a real-time architecture using Firebase Firestore. Any change made in the admin panel, such as updating a vegetable's price, is reflected instantly in every user's mobile app.
